# pgSystemTester GitHub Page
Since 2020, I've been using GitHub more frequently as a place to host various code and technical gems I've captured. I'm aware that much of what I
post is not actually a _**project**_ (the intended use of Github). However, Github's clean code interface combined with the fact that this site isn't blocked by most
of my customers makes it a good fit.

If you find any of my open repositories useful, feel free to fork, comment, like or whatever people do.

## Repoositories
While I've posted [several repositories](https://github.com/PGSystemTester?tab=repositories), 
I think these might be the most interesting if you like the respective coding:
- **[VBA](https://github.com/PGSystemTester/vbaPublic)** (Misc collection of functions and routines, primarily for Excel)
- Chip Pearson
- Adobe Scripting
- **[Google App Scripts](https://github.com/PGSystemTester/Google-App-Scripts-Tools)** I've written (pretty basic)
    - [Forms](https://github.com/PGSystemTester/Google-App-Scripts-Tools/tree/main/Forms)
    - [Sheets](https://github.com/PGSystemTester/Google-App-Scripts-Tools/tree/main/sheets)

# Misc Interests Since the Pandemic
Being isolated at home brought these new interests to my life. 

## Chess
If you think someone who is in the top 1% of contributors to Stack Overflow is also inherently good at chess... _**you're wrong!_** I'm pretty terrible.
Check out [my profile](https://www.chess.com/member/pgsystemtester) on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com). I am constantly crushed by little kids.

## PDF Scripting
I've been rather intrigued by forms and PDF interaction lately. While it seems dull (even as I type this) it does seem to hold my interest for making 
clean documents
- My PDF Scripting (please contribute!)

## Video Games
I play Fortnite quite a bit. Shoot me an invite and let's ready up and send some kids to the lobby.
